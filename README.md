## About

Welcome to Stellar! This app was developed by Stephen Anderson (@stephenandersondev) and Ben Looper (@BenLooper) as part of week 12 of the Flatiron School Software Engineering program. It is an educational platform for students to research, create, and present space science projects. It utilizes a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend.
