    Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot
    of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a
    photograph beside the deployed United States flag
    during Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on
    the lunar surface. The Lunar Module (LM) is on the
    left, and the footprints of the astronauts are
    clearly visible in the soil of the moon. Astronaut
    Neil A. Armstrong, commander, took this picture
    with a 70mm Hasselblad lunar surface camera. While
    astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the LM
    the \"Eagle\" to explore the Sea of Tranquility
    region of the moon, astronaut Michael Collins,
    command module pilot, remained with the Command and
    Service Modules (CSM) \"Columbia\" in lunar
    orbit.",
